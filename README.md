## 🚀 Steps to Build the Dashboard  

### 1. Import Data to SQL Database  
**A) Prepare CSV Files**  
- Clean and format the raw dataset.  
- Ensure data types (date, numeric, text) are correct.  
- Remove duplicates or null values if needed.  

**B) Create Tables in SQL**  
- Design relational tables for structured storage.  
- Define primary keys and relationships.  

**C) Import CSV Files into SQL**  
- Load CSV data into SQL tables using bulk insert / import wizard.  
- Validate the imported data with SQL queries.

### 2. Build Dashboard in Power BI / Tableau  
- Connect SQL database to visualization tool.  
- Import data models and relationships.  
- Create **interactive visuals** for weekly analysis.

## 📊 Key Features of the Dashboard  
- **Weekly Performance Overview** – Transaction volume & revenue trends.  
- **Customer Insights** – Spending patterns and user segmentation.  
- **Category Analysis** – Distribution of transactions across categories.  
- **KPI Tracking** – Credit utilization, delinquency rates, and active accounts.  
- **Geographical Insights** – Region-wise card usage and performance.

## 🧮 DAX Queries (Power BI)  
DAX was used to create **calculated columns** and **measures** for advanced analytics. Examples include:  
- New columns for **week number** or **customer segments**.  
- Measures for **total transactions, total revenue, average spend per customer, utilization ratio, delinquency percentage**, etc.
